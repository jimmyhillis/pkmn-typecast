# PKMN-Typécast

Every time I play a PKMN game I run into the same problem. I don't know the of the Pokémon I am in battle with. As I have no intention of remembering them all I wrote an app to do it for me.

Type in the name of the Pokémon you are battling and it will tell the the move types which are _VERY EFFECTIVE_ or _NOT VERY EFFECTIVE_ so you can quickly decide on your own Pokémon and move when in a battle.

Cheating? Whatever.
